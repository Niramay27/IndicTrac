Process 10937 has 1.90 GiB memory in use. Process 11923 has 1.89 GiB memory in use. Process 57423 has 13.31 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 21.76 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 20.01 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 1.24 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
